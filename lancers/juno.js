Like so many others, she hoped to be sponsored by one of the Trusts and gain entry into Atlas. Omni officials were initially alerted to her as a security threat, given that she'd taken out twenty armed raiders with stones (at first), and later with the weapons she'd acquired along the way. After monitoring her for a short time, Omni soon saw her potential and sponsored her as a security trainee. The doors of Atlas were finally open.","Friends":"Asana|Seen having lunch at Omni-Plex.","Rivals":"Celeste|Juno has some strong suspicions about Celeste\u2019s involvement in Omni break-ins.","Achievements":"","Skins":"","Trivia =  Voiced By: [http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm5235708\/?ref_":"ttfc_fc_cl_t2 Mara Junot]"},"abilities":[{"Name":"Laser Barrage","Phase":"Blast","Cooldown":"","Is Free":"No","Description":"Fire a barrage of lasers from each cannon.
